# Privacy Policy for Alt Text Creator

Alt Text Creator is committed to respecting your privacy and being transparent about the collected data. This policy outlines what information is transmitted during the installation and use of Alt Text Creator, how it is used, and how you can control the collection.

## Information collected by Alt Text Creator

Alt Text Creator uses the OpenAI API to generate alternate text, which is subject to the [OpenAI privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy). OpenAI says [images are deleted](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision/can-i-delete-an-image-i-uploaded) after they are processed.

Alt Text Creator stores your API keys and other settings in your web browser. That data may be synchronized to your other devices through your web browser's cloud account (e.g. a Firefox Account in Firefox). You can [delete API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) from the OpenAI website if your device or web browser syncronization has been compromised. The extension does not transmit any information about you or your device, except sending the API key and URL for a given image to OpenAI to create the alternative text.
