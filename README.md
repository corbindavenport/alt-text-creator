# Alt Text Creator

Alt Text Creator is a browser extension that generates [alternate text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute) for images using the [GPT-4o or GPT-4o Mini model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) from OpenAI. You can right-click on any image and select "Create Alt Text" to generate the text, which is then copied to your clipboard. Alt Text Creator can also use a custom local server with an OpenAI-like API, such as [ML Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).

**You must supply your own API key from OpenAI and be on [usage tier 1](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4-gpt-4-turbo-gpt-4o-and-gpt-4o-mini#:~:text=usage%20tier%201) for the extension to work.** Alt Text Creator uses the Low Resolution mode in the API and local caching to reduce the per-image processing cost. The [current pricing](https://openai.com/pricing#:~:text=Vision%20pricing%20calculator) is available on OpenAI's website.
